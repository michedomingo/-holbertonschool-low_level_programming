### Tasks

#### File:Â [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
- Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output should be saved in the file c

#### File:Â [1-compiler](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
- Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c

#### File:Â [2-assembler](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
- Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

#### File:Â [3-name](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
- Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

#### File:Â [4-puts.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
- Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
- Use the function puts

#### File:Â [5-printf.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
- Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
- Use the function printf

#### File:Â [6-size.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
- Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- You should produce the exact same output as in the example.

#### URL:Â [Medium](https://medium.com/@michedomingo/compiling-a-c-program-b0d585fe0b25)
- Write a blog post that explains all the steps of compilation.
- What happens when you type gcc main.c

- Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
