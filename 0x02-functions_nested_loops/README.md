## Tasks
> You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden (unless permitted in task instructions). 

#### File:Â [0-holberton.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-holberton.c)
- Write a program that prints Holberton.

#### File:Â [1-alphabet.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c)
- Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase.
- You can only use _putchar twice

#### File:Â [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/2-alphabet_x10)
- Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase.
- You can only use _putchar twice

#### File:Â [3-islower.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/3-islower.c)
- Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
- Return: 1 if letter, otherwise 0

#### File:Â [4-isalpha.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/4-isalpha.c)
- Write a function that checks for alphabetic character, lowercase or uppercase.
- Return: 1 if c is a letter, otherwise 0

### File:Â [5-sign.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/5-sign.c)
- Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

### File:Â [6-abs.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/6-abs.c)
- Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

- Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### File:Â [11-print_to_98.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/11-print_to_98.c)
- Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in order
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
