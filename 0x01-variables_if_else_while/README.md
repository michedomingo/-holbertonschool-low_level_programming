## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- File:Â [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

### 1. The last digit
- Assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- File:Â [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- You can only use putchar twice

## 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, in ascending order.
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- You can only use putchar four times
