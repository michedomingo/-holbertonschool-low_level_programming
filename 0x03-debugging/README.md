### Tasks

#### File:Â [0-main.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c), [holberton.h](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/holberton.h)
- Create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function [positive_or_negative()](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

#### File:Â [1-main.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)
- Copy this main file. Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

#### File:Â [2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c), [holberton.h](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/holberton.h)
- Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

#### File:Â [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c), [holberton.h](https://github.com/michedomingo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/holberton.h)
- Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
